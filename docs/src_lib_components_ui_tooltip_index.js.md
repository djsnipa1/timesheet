# index.js

## Summary
This code provides a simple way to create tooltips in a Svelte application using the `bits-ui` library. It exports the necessary components for creating a tooltip, including the root container, the trigger element, and the content to be displayed.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this code is to re-export and alias specific components from the `bits-ui` library related to tooltips. This allows developers to import and use these components with a more convenient and consistent naming convention within the application.

## Key Components
- Root: The main container for the tooltip. It's responsible for managing the tooltip's state and positioning.
- Trigger: The element that, when hovered or focused, will trigger the tooltip to appear.
- Content: The actual content that will be displayed within the tooltip.

## Dependencies
- bits-ui: A UI library providing the base `Tooltip` components.

## Code Highlights
The code utilizes component aliasing to provide more descriptive names for the `bits-ui` tooltip components. This improves code readability and maintainability by making the purpose of each component more explicit (e.g., `Tooltip` instead of `Root`).

## Detailed Documentation
This module exports components for creating tooltips. Here's how you can use them:

**Importing the components:**

```javascript
import { Tooltip, TooltipTrigger, TooltipContent } from '$lib/components/ui/tooltip';
```

**Basic Usage:**

```svelte
<Tooltip>
  <TooltipTrigger>
    Hover me
  </TooltipTrigger>
  <TooltipContent>
    This is the tooltip content!
  </TooltipContent>
</Tooltip>
```

**Explanation:**

*   `Tooltip`: This is the root component that wraps the trigger and content.
*   `TooltipTrigger`: This is the element that the user interacts with to show the tooltip.  It could be a button, a link, or any other HTML element.
*   `TooltipContent`: This is the content that is displayed when the tooltip is triggered. It can contain text, images, or any other HTML elements.

**Note:** The `bits-ui` library handles the positioning and styling of the tooltip. You can customize the appearance further using CSS or by passing props to the components (refer to the `bits-ui` documentation for available props).
