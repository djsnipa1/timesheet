# index.js

## Summary
This code exports the `Root` component from `./progress.svelte` and also exports it under the alias `Progress`. It serves as the main entry point for the Progress component in the user interface library.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this code is to make the `Progress` component easily accessible for import and use throughout the larger application. It acts as a central module for exporting the component.

## Key Components
- Root: The main Svelte component that implements the progress bar functionality. It's imported from './progress.svelte'.

## Dependencies
- ./progress.svelte: This is the internal Svelte component file containing the implementation details of the progress bar.

## Code Highlights
This code utilizes a simple export pattern to expose the `Root` component with two different names (`Root` and `Progress`). This provides flexibility for developers using the component, allowing them to choose the import name that best suits their needs or coding style.

## Detailed Documentation
This module exports the `Progress` component, which is a visual indicator of a process's completion status. To use the component, import it as follows:

```javascript
import { Progress } from './path/to/this/module';

// Alternatively, you can import it as Root
import { Root } from './path/to/this/module';
```

The `Progress` component is implemented in `progress.svelte`, which should contain the component's logic, styling, and markup.  Refer to `progress.svelte` for details on available props and customization options.
