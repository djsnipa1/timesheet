  "project_summary": "# Project Overview\n\n## Project Purpose\n\nThis project is a SvelteKit application designed to track and manage employee time entries, likely integrated with the Clockify API. It aims to provide a user-friendly interface for employees to view and manage their time, and for administrators to gain insights into team productivity. The application emphasizes a consistent and customizable user experience through the use of Tailwind CSS and a well-defined UI component library.\n\n## Key Features\n\n*   **Time Entry Management:** Allows users to view and potentially manage their time entries, fetched from the Clockify API.\n*   **User Authentication:** Securely authenticates users via API keys to access their data.\n*   **Theming Support:** Offers both light and dark themes, customizable through CSS variables.\n*   **Reusable UI Components:** Provides a library of pre-styled UI components (buttons, cards, dropdowns, etc.) for a consistent look and feel.\n*   **Date-Based Routing:** Organizes and displays data based on year and month, allowing for easy navigation through historical time entries.\n\n## Architecture\n\nThe application follows a typical SvelteKit structure, leveraging server-side rendering (SSR) for improved performance and SEO. The frontend, built with Svelte, consumes data from API endpoints defined within the `src/routes/api` directory. These endpoints act as a bridge to the Clockify API, handling authentication and data transformation. The UI is constructed using reusable Svelte components, styled with Tailwind CSS, and organized into a component library for easy reuse and maintainability. The application uses Svelte stores to manage application state, such as employee data and time entries.\n\n## Technical Stack\n\n*   **Frontend Framework:** SvelteKit\n*   **UI Library:** Custom component library built with Svelte and Tailwind CSS, leveraging `bits-ui` for some components.\n*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with custom theme configuration.\n*   **API Communication:** `fetch` API (browser and Node.js), `node-fetch` (server-side).\n*   **Build Tool:** Vite\n*   **Deployment:** Cloudflare\n*   **Configuration:** ESLint, Prettier, PostCSS\n\n## Getting Started\n\n1.  **Clone the repository.**\n2.  **Install dependencies:** `npm install` or `yarn install` or `pnpm install`.\n3.  **Set up environment variables:** Create a `.env` file and add your Clockify API key (`CLOCKIFY_API_KEY`).\n4.  **Run the development server:** `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` or `pnpm dev`.\n5.  **Open your browser** to the address shown in the console (usually `http://localhost:5173`).\n\n## Project Structure\n\n*   **`src/`:** Contains the main application code.\n    *   **`app.html`:** The root HTML document.\n    *   **`app.css`:** Global CSS styles, including theme definitions.\n    *   **`lib/`:** Reusable modules and components.\n        *   **`api/`:** API utility functions (e.g., `timeEntryApi.js`, `api.js`).\n        *   **`components/ui/`:** Reusable UI components (buttons, cards, etc.).\n        *   **`server/`:** Server-side utility functions (e.g., `api.js`).\n        *   **`stores/`:** Svelte stores for managing application state (e.g., `employeeStore.js`).\n        *   **`utils.js`:** Utility functions (e.g., `cn` for class name management).\n    *   **`routes/`:** SvelteKit routes and API endpoints.\n        *   **`+page.server.js`:** Server-side logic for the root page (redirects to current month).\n        *   **`api/`:** API endpoints (e.g., `time-entries/+server.js`, `user/+server.js`).\n        *   **`[year]/[month]/+page.server.js`:** Server-side logic for date-based routes.\n*   **`svelte.config.js`:** SvelteKit configuration file.\n*   **`tailwind.config.js`:** Tailwind CSS configuration file.\n*   **`vite.config.js`:** Vite configuration file.\n*   **`eslint.config.js`:** ESLint configuration file.\n*   **`postcss.config.js`:** PostCSS configuration file.\n",

      "documentation": "# src\\app.css\n\n## Summary\nThis CSS code configures the styling for a web application using Tailwind CSS. It defines a set of custom CSS variables for theming, including colors for the background, foreground, cards, and various UI elements, and sets up both light and dark mode color schemes.\n\n## Purpose\nThe primary purpose of this code is to establish a consistent and customizable visual theme for the application. It leverages CSS variables to manage color palettes and applies these variables to the base styles of the application, ensuring a unified look and feel across different components and modes (light and dark).\n\n## Key Components\n*   `:root`: Defines CSS variables for the default (light) theme.\n*   `.dark`: Defines CSS variables for the dark theme, which overrides the default theme when the `dark` class is applied to the `html` element (typically done automatically by Tailwind based on system preferences or user selection).\n*   `@layer base`: A Tailwind CSS directive used to inject custom base styles. This ensures that the styles are applied at the correct layer in the CSS cascade, before components and utilities.\n\n## Dependencies\n*   Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework used for styling the application. This code relies on Tailwind's base styles, components, and utilities.\n\n## Code Highlights\n*   **CSS Variables for Theming:** The code uses CSS variables (custom properties) to define a theming system. This allows for easy modification of the color scheme by simply changing the values of the variables. The use of HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) color values makes it easier to adjust the color scheme.\n*   **Dark Mode Support:** The code provides a separate set of CSS variables for the dark theme, allowing the application to switch between light and dark modes seamlessly. The `.dark` class is typically applied to the `html` element using JavaScript or by Tailwind's dark mode variant.\n*   **Tailwind CSS `@layer` Directive:** The `@layer base` directive is used to inject custom styles into Tailwind's base styles. This ensures that the custom styles are applied at the correct layer in the CSS cascade, before components and utilities. This is important for ensuring that the custom styles are not overridden by Tailwind's default styles.\n\n## Detailed Documentation\n\n### CSS Variables (`:root` and `.dark`)\n\nThe code defines a set of CSS variables for theming. These variables are used to control the colors of various UI elements, such as the background, foreground, cards, and buttons.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```css\n:root {\n  --background: 0.980 0.018 81.314; /* Light background color */\n  --foreground: 0.320 0.025 81.314; /* Light foreground color */\n  --primary: 0.116 0.022 226.938;   /* Primary color */\n}\n\n.dark {\n  --background: 0.245 0.006 81.314; /* Dark background color */\n  --foreground: 0.933 0.040 81.314; /* Dark foreground color */\n  --primary: 0.426 0.071 226.938;   /* Primary color in dark mode */\n}\n```\n\nThese variables are defined within the `:root` selector for the default (light) theme and within the `.dark` selector for the dark theme. The `.dark` selector is typically applied to the `html` element when the user prefers a dark theme.\n\n### Tailwind CSS `@layer` Directive\n\nThe `@layer base` directive is used to inject custom styles into Tailwind's base styles. This ensures that the styles are applied at the correct layer in the CSS cascade.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```css\n@layer base {\n  * {\n    @apply border-border; /* Apply border color to all elements */\n  }\n  body {\n    @apply bg-background text-foreground; /* Apply background and text colors to the body */\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `@apply` directive is used to apply Tailwind CSS utility classes to the `*` and `body` elements. The `border-border` class applies the border color defined by the `--border` CSS variable, and the `bg-background` and `text-foreground` classes apply the background and text colors defined by the `--background` and `--foreground` CSS variables, respectively.\n\n### Usage Notes\n*   To use the CSS variables in your components, you can reference them using the `var()` function. For example, to set the background color of a div to the value of the `--background` variable, you would use the following CSS:\n\n    ```css\n    div {\n      background-color: hsl(var(--background));\n    }\n    ```\n\n*   To enable dark mode, you can add the `dark` class to the `html` element. This will cause the CSS variables defined within the `.dark` selector to be applied.\n\n    ```html\n    <html class=\"dark\">\n    <head>\n    ...\n    </head>\n    <body>\n    ...\n    </body>\n    </html>\n    ```\n\n*   Tailwind CSS can automatically apply the `dark` class based on the user's system preferences. To enable this feature, you need to configure the `darkMode` option in your `tailwind.config.js` file.\n\n    ```javascript\n    // tailwind.config.js\n    module.exports = {\n      darkMode: 'media', // or 'class'\n      theme: {\n        extend: {},\n      },\n      variants: {},\n      plugins: [],\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Setting `darkMode` to `'media'` will enable dark mode based on the user's system preferences, while setting it to `'class'` will require you to manually add the `dark` class to the `html` element.\n"

You typically won't modify these directly.\n\nThe `data-sveltekit-preload-data=\"hover\"` attribute on the `<body>` tag tells SvelteKit to preload data for links when the user hovers over them, improving perceived performance.  This is a common optimization technique in SvelteKit applications.\n\nThe `<div style=\"display: contents\">` wrapper is used to avoid introducing an extra DOM node in the final rendered output. `display: contents` effectively removes the `<div>` from the rendering tree, while still allowing it to serve as a container for the `%sveltekit.body%` placeholder during the build process.\n\n**Example:**\nIf a Svelte component defines a `<title>` tag, SvelteKit will inject that tag into the `<head>` section at the `%sveltekit.head%` placeholder. Similarly, the rendered output of your Svelte components will be placed within the `<body>` at the `%sveltekit.body%` placeholder."

It simplifies making authenticated API requests by automatically adding necessary headers, such as the API key, and handling basic error checking.\n\n### Function: `fetchWithAuth`\n\n#### Purpose\nThe `fetchWithAuth` function is designed to streamline API calls within the application. It ensures that all requests are properly authenticated and that errors are handled consistently.\n\n#### Parameters\n*   `endpoint` (string): The API endpoint to which the request is made (e.g., `/users`, `/products`). This will be appended to the `API_BASE_URL`.\n*   `options` (object, optional): An object containing request options, such as `method` (e.g., 'GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE'), `body`, and any custom `headers`.  Defaults to an empty object.\n\n#### Returns\n*   A Promise that resolves to the JSON response from the API if the request is successful.\n\n#### Throws\n*   An Error object if the API call fails (i.e., the response status is not ok).\n\n#### Usage\n\n```javascript\nimport { fetchWithAuth } from './api.js';\n\nasync function getData() {\n  try {\n    const data = await fetchWithAuth('/data', {\n      method: 'GET',\n      headers: {\n        'Custom-Header': 'CustomValue'\n      }\n    });\n    console.log(data);\n    return data;\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);\n    throw error; // Re-throw to allow calling functions to handle the error as well\n  }\n}\n\n// Example of a POST request\nasync function postData(payload) {\n    try {\n        const response = await fetchWithAuth('/items', {\n            method: 'POST',\n            headers: {\n                'Content-Type': 'application/json'\n            },\n            body: JSON.stringify(payload)\n        });\n        console.log('Success:', response);\n        return response;\n    } catch (error) {\n        console.error('Error posting data:', error);\n        throw error;\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\n#### Details\n\n1.  **API Base URL:** The `API_BASE_URL` constant defines the base URL for all API requests.  It's assumed this is defined elsewhere (e.g., at the top of the `api.js` file).\n2.  **Headers:** The function automatically adds the `X-Api-Key` header using the value from the `VITE_CLOCKIFY_API_KEY` environment variable. It also sets the `Content-Type` to `application/json` by default.  Any headers provided in the `options` parameter will override these defaults.\n3.  **Error Handling:** If the API response has a status code that indicates an error (i.e., `response.ok` is false), the function throws an error with a descriptive message.\n4. **Environment Variables:** The code relies on `import.meta.env.VITE_CLOCKIFY_API_KEY` to access the API key. Ensure that this environment variable is properly set in your project's `.env` file or environment configuration.\n"

      "documentation": "The `badgeVariants` function is created using `tailwind-variants`. It accepts a configuration object that defines the base styles, variants, and default variants for the badge. \n\n**Base Styles:**\nThe `base` property defines the common styles that apply to all badge variants. These styles include properties like `inline-flex`, `items-center`, `rounded-full`, `border`, `px-2.5`, `py-0.5`, `text-xs`, `font-semibold`, and `transition-colors`.\n\n**Variants:**\nThe `variants` property defines the different styles that can be applied to the badge based on the `variant` property. The available variants are:\n\n*   `default`: Applies the primary background and text colors.\n*   `secondary`: Applies the secondary background and text colors.\n*   `destructive`: Applies the destructive background and text colors.\n*   `outline`: Applies the foreground text color with a border.\n\n**Default Variants:**\nThe `defaultVariants` property sets the default variant for the badge to `default`. This means that if no `variant` property is specified, the badge will use the `default` variant styles.\n\n**Usage:**\n\nTo use the `badgeVariants` function, you can call it with the desired variant property. For example:\n\n```javascript\nimport { badgeVariants } from './index.js';\n\nconst defaultBadgeClasses = badgeVariants(); // Returns classes for the default variant\nconst secondaryBadgeClasses = badgeVariants({ variant: 'secondary' }); // Returns classes for the secondary variant\n```\n\nThe `Badge` component (imported from `./badge.svelte`) is expected to use these classes to render the badge with the appropriate styles.  The Svelte component likely accepts a `variant` prop to determine which style to apply using the `badgeVariants` function."

It provides a flexible and reusable button with various styles and sizes, making it easy to create consistent buttons throughout the application.\n\n## Purpose\nThe primary purpose of this code is to create a customizable button component with predefined styles and sizes, ensuring a consistent look and feel across the application. It leverages `tailwind-variants` to manage button styles efficiently.\n\n## Key Components\n*   **Root**: This is the Svelte component (`button.svelte`) that actually renders the button element. It's the core of the button's structure and functionality.\n*   **buttonVariants**: This is where the magic happens! It's a `tailwind-variants` object that defines all the possible styles for the button. It includes:\n    *   `base`:  The base styles that apply to all buttons (e.g., padding, font, rounded corners).\n    *   `variants`: An object defining different button styles (e.g., `default`, `destructive`, `outline`) and sizes (e.g., `default`, `sm`, `lg`, `icon`).\n    *   `defaultVariants`: Sets the default style and size for the button.\n\n## Dependencies\n*   **tailwind-variants**: This library is crucial. It allows you to define Tailwind CSS styles as variants, making it easy to create different button styles without writing a lot of repetitive CSS.\n*   **./button.svelte**: This is the actual Svelte component file that this `index.js` file is exporting.\n\n## Code Highlights\n*   **`tailwind-variants` for Styling**: The use of `tailwind-variants` is a key highlight. It provides a type-safe and composable way to manage button styles. This makes it easier to create different button styles and ensures consistency.\n*   **Variant-Based Styling**: The `variants` object allows you to define different button styles (like `default`, `destructive`, etc.) and sizes. This makes it easy to create a variety of button styles with minimal code.\n*   **Default Variants**: The `defaultVariants` object sets the default style and size for the button. This simplifies the process of creating common button styles.\n\n## Detailed Documentation\n\n### `buttonVariants`\n\nThis is the core of the styling system. It uses `tailwind-variants` to define the button's appearance.\n\n*   **Base Styles**: These styles are applied to all buttons, regardless of their variant or size.\n\n    ```javascript\n    base: \"ring-offset-background focus-visible:ring-ring inline-flex items-center justify-center whitespace-nowrap rounded-md text-sm font-medium transition-colors focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-offset-2 disabled:pointer-events-none disabled:opacity-50\",\n    ```\n\n    These styles include things like:\n\n    *   `ring-offset-background`:  Sets the ring offset color.\n    *   `focus-visible:ring-ring`: Styles for when the button is focused (using a ring).\n    *   `inline-flex items-center justify-center`: Centers the button's content.\n    *   `whitespace-nowrap`: Prevents text from wrapping.\n    *   `rounded-md`:  Gives the button rounded corners.\n    *   `text-sm font-medium`: Sets the font size and weight.\n    *   `transition-colors`:  Adds a smooth color transition on hover.\n    *   `disabled:pointer-events-none disabled:opacity-50`: Styles for disabled buttons.\n\n*   **Variants**: These are the different styles and sizes you can apply to the button.\n\n    *   **`variant`**: Defines the button's style (e.g., `default`, `destructive`, `outline`).\n\n        ```javascript\n        variant: {\n            default: \"bg-primary text-primary-foreground hover:bg-primary/90\",\n            destructive: \"bg-destructive text-destructive-foreground hover:bg-destructive/90\",\n            outline:\n                \"border-input bg-background hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground border\",\n            secondary: \"bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80\",\n            ghost: \"hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground\",\n            link: \"text-primary underline-offset-4 hover:underline\",\n        },\n        ```\n\n        *   `default`: The primary button style.\n        *   `destructive`:  A button style for destructive actions (e.g., deleting something).\n        *   `outline`: A button with a border.\n        *   `secondary`: A secondary button style.\n        *   `ghost`: A transparent button.\n        *   `link`: A button that looks like a link.\n\n    *   **`size`**: Defines the button's size.\n\n        ```javascript\n        size: {\n            default: \"h-10 px-4 py-2\",\n            sm: \"h-9 rounded-md px-3\",\n            lg: \"h-11 rounded-md px-8\",\n            icon: \"h-10 w-10\",\n        },\n        ```\n\n        *   `default`: The standard button size.\n        *   `sm`: A smaller button size.\n        *   `lg`: A larger button size.\n        *   `icon`: A square button, typically used for icons.\n\n*   **Default Variants**: These set the default style and size for the button.\n\n    ```javascript\n    defaultVariants: {\n        variant: \"default\",\n        size: \"default\",\n    },\n    ```\n\n    By default, buttons will use the `default` variant and `default` size.\n\n### Usage\n\nTo use this button component in your Svelte application:\n\n1.  **Import the `Button` component:**\n\n    ```svelte\n    <script>\n        import { Button } from '$lib/components/ui/button';\n    </script>\n    ```\n\n2.  **Use the `Button` component in your template:**\n\n    ```svelte\n    <Button>Click me</Button>\n    <Button variant=\"destructive\">Delete</Button>\n    <Button size=\"sm\">Small Button</Button>\n    <Button variant=\"outline\" size=\"lg\">Large Outline Button</Button>\n    ```\n\n3.  **Customize the button using the `variant` and `size` props:**\n\n    *   `variant`:  Use this prop to change the button's style (e.g., `default`, `destructive`, `outline`).\n    *   `size`: Use this prop to change the button's size (e.g., `default`, `sm`, `lg`, `icon`).\n\nThis setup provides a flexible and maintainable way to create buttons in your Svelte application, ensuring a consistent look and feel throughout your project."

      "documentation": "This code defines a Sheet component in Svelte, offering a versatile way to present content in a sliding panel. Let's break down how to use it:\n\n**Basic Usage:**\n\n1.  **Import the components:**\n\n    ```javascript\n    import { Sheet, SheetTrigger, SheetContent, SheetHeader, SheetTitle, SheetDescription, SheetClose } from '$lib/components/ui/sheet';\n    ```\n\n2.  **Implement the Sheet:**\n\n    ```svelte\n    <Sheet>\n      <SheetTrigger>Open Sheet</SheetTrigger>\n      <SheetContent side=\"right\">\n        <SheetHeader>\n          <SheetTitle>Profile</SheetTitle>\n          <SheetDescription>\n            Make changes to your profile here. Click save when you're done.\n          </SheetDescription>\n        </SheetHeader>\n        <!-- Sheet content goes here -->\n        <SheetClose>Close</SheetClose>\n      </SheetContent>\n    </Sheet>\n    ```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   `Sheet`: The main wrapper component.\n*   `SheetTrigger`: The element that, when clicked, opens the sheet.  It uses the `bits-ui` Dialog.Trigger under the hood.\n*   `SheetContent`:  The container for the sheet's content. The `side` prop determines which side of the screen the sheet slides in from (top, bottom, left, right).  Defaults to `right`.\n*   `SheetHeader`: An optional header for the sheet, typically containing a title and description.\n*   `SheetTitle`: The title of the sheet.\n*   `SheetDescription`: A description or subtitle for the sheet.\n*   `SheetClose`: A button that closes the sheet. It uses the `bits-ui` Dialog.Close under the hood.\n\n**Customization:**\n\n*   **Side:** Use the `side` prop on `SheetContent` to control the sheet's position.  Example: `<SheetContent side=\"left\">`.\n*   **Styling:**  The `sheetVariants` object provides a base style and variants for different sides. You can extend or override these styles using Tailwind CSS classes.\n*   **Transitions:** The `sheetTransitions` object defines the animations.  You can customize these animations to fit your design.\n\n**Accessibility:**\n\nThe Sheet component is built with accessibility in mind, leveraging the `bits-ui` Dialog primitive. This includes proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation.\n\n**Example with custom styling:**\n\n```svelte\n<Sheet>\n  <SheetTrigger class=\"bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded\">Open Sheet</SheetTrigger>\n  <SheetContent side=\"bottom\" class=\"sm:max-w-md\">\n    <SheetHeader>\n      <SheetTitle>Terms of Service</SheetTitle>\n    </SheetHeader>\n    <!-- Terms of service content -->\n    <SheetClose class=\"absolute top-4 right-4\">Close</SheetClose>\n  </SheetContent>\n</Sheet>\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates how to add custom Tailwind CSS classes to the trigger button and the sheet content to modify their appearance.\n"

It handles fetching data from an API, managing loading states, and handling errors, providing a centralized way to access and update employee-related information within the application.\n\n## Purpose\nThe primary purpose of `employeeStore.js` is to provide a reactive data store for employee information and time entries. It encapsulates the logic for fetching, updating, and managing this data, making it easily accessible and consistent across different components of the Svelte application.\n\n## Key Components\n*   **createEmployeeStore**: This function is the factory for creating the employee store. It initializes the store with default values (employee: null, timeEntries: [], isLoading: false, error: null) and defines methods for interacting with the store.\n\n*   **writable**: This is a Svelte store function that creates a writable store. The `employeeStore` uses `writable` to hold the application's state, including employee details, time entries, loading status, and any errors that occur.\n\n*   **fetchAll**: This asynchronous function is responsible for fetching employee data and time entries. In development, it uses mock data. In production, it fetches data from the API endpoints `/api/time-entries`. It updates the store with the fetched data or sets an error state if something goes wrong.\n\n*   **reset**: This function resets the `employeeStore` to its initial state, effectively clearing any stored employee data, time entries, and error messages. It's useful for scenarios like logging out a user.\n\n## Dependencies\n*   `svelte/store`:  Svelte's built-in module for creating reactive stores.\n*   `$lib/api/timeEntryApi`: A custom module (likely containing `fetchJson`) for making API requests.\n*   `$lib/data/mockTimeEntries.json`: A JSON file containing mock data for use during development.\n\n## Code Highlights\n*   **Svelte Store**: The code leverages Svelte's store system to create a reactive data container.  Components can subscribe to the `employeeStore` and automatically update when the store's data changes.\n*   **Asynchronous Data Fetching**: The `fetchAll` function uses `async/await` to handle asynchronous API calls, making the code more readable and easier to follow.\n*   **Environment-Based Configuration**: The code checks `import.meta.env.DEV` to determine whether to use mock data (in development) or fetch data from the API (in production).\n*   **Error Handling**: The code includes error handling using `try...catch` blocks and the `setError` function to update the store's error state, providing a mechanism for displaying error messages in the UI.\n\n## Detailed Documentation\n\n### 1. createEmployeeStore Function\nThis function encapsulates the store's logic. It initializes the store with the following structure:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  employee: null, // Employee data (initially null)\n  timeEntries: [], // Array of time entries (initially empty)\n  isLoading: false, // Boolean indicating whether data is being loaded\n  error: null      // Error message, if any\n}\n```\n\nIt then defines the following methods:\n\n*   **subscribe**: Inherited from `writable`. Allows components to subscribe to store updates.\n*   **fetchAll**: Fetches employee data and time entries from the API or mock data.\n*   **reset**: Resets the store to its initial state.\n\n### 2. fetchAll Function\nThis function fetches data and updates the store. Here's a breakdown:\n\n1.  **Set Loading State**: `setLoading()` is called to set `isLoading` to `true` and clear any existing errors.\n2.  **Conditional Data Source**:\n    *   If `import.meta.env.DEV` is true (i.e., in development), it uses mock data from `mockTimeEntriesData` to update the store.\n    *   Otherwise, it fetches data from the `/api/time-entries` endpoint using `fetchJson`.\n3.  **Update Store**: If the API call is successful, it updates the store with the fetched employee data and time entries.\n4.  **Error Handling**: If any error occurs during the process, it calls `setError` to update the store's error state.\n\nExample Usage:\n\n```javascript\nimport { employeeStore } from './employeeStore';\n\n// In a Svelte component:\n\n$: {\n  employeeStore.fetchAll(); // Fetch data when the component initializes\n}\n\n// Accessing store values:\n\nlet employee;\nlet timeEntries;\n\nemployeeStore.subscribe(value => {\n  employee = value.employee;\n  timeEntries = value.timeEntries;\n});\n```\n\n### 3. reset Function\nThis function resets the store to its initial state. This is useful for scenarios like user logout or when you need to clear the store's data.\n\nExample Usage:\n\n```javascript\nimport { employeeStore } from './employeeStore';\n\n// Reset the store:\nemployeeStore.reset();\n```\n\n### 4. Data Structures\n\n*   **Employee Data**: The structure of the employee data is determined by the API response or the `mockTimeEntriesData.user` object.  It's assumed to be a JavaScript object with properties like `id`, `name`, `email`, etc.\n*   **Time Entries**: The `timeEntries` array contains objects representing individual time entries. Each time entry object has the following properties:\n    *   `id`: Unique identifier for the time entry.\n    *   `description`: Description of the work done.\n    *   `timeInterval`: An object containing `start`, `end`, and `duration` properties.\n    *   `workspaceId`: ID of the workspace.\n    *   `userId`: ID of the user.\n    *   `billable`: Boolean indicating whether the time entry is billable.\n    *   `projectId`: ID of the project.\n    *   `isLocked`: Boolean indicating whether the time entry is locked.\n\n### 5. Error Handling\nThe code includes basic error handling. When an error occurs during data fetching, the `setError` function is called to update the store's `error` property. This allows components to display error messages to the user.\n\nExample:\n\n```svelte\n{#if $employeeStore.error}\n  <p class=\"error\">Error: {$employeeStore.error}</p>\n{/if}\n```\n\n### 6.  fetchTimeEntries Function\nThis function is responsible for fetching time entries from the API and parsing the response. It addresses a specific structure of the API response where time intervals are nested. It extracts and restructures the data into a more manageable format for the application.\n\nKey aspects:\n\n*   **API Endpoint**: It fetches data from the `/api/time-entries` endpoint.\n*   **Response Validation**: It checks if the response contains a `timeEntries` array.\n*   **Data Transformation**: It transforms the structure of each time entry to include a `timeInterval` object with `start`, `end`, and `duration` properties.\n\nThis function ensures that the time entry data is consistently formatted before being stored in the `employeeStore`.\n"

It uses `clsx` to handle conditional class names and `tailwind-merge` to resolve conflicts between Tailwind CSS classes.\n\n    *   **Parameters**: Accepts any number of arguments that `clsx` can handle (strings, objects, arrays).\n    *   **Returns**: A string containing the merged and processed class names.\n    *   **Example**:\n\n        ```javascript\n        import { cn } from '$lib/utils';\n\n        // Basic usage\n        const className = cn('bg-blue-500', 'text-white', { 'font-bold': true });\n        // Result: 'bg-blue-500 text-white font-bold'\n        ```\n*   **flyAndScale(node, params = { y: -8, x: 0, start: 0.95, duration: 150 })**: A Svelte transition function that makes an element 'fly' in and scale up as it appears.\n\n    *   **Parameters**:\n        *   `node`: The DOM node to which the transition is applied. (Svelte provides this automatically)\n        *   `params`: (Optional) An object with the following properties:\n            *   `y`: The vertical distance the element flies from (default: -8).\n            *   `x`: The horizontal distance the element flies from (default: 0).\n            *   `start`: The initial scale of the element (default: 0.95).\n            *   `duration`: The duration of the animation in milliseconds (default: 150).\n    *   **Returns**: An object with `duration`, `delay`, `css`, and `easing` properties, as expected by Svelte transitions.\n    *   **Example**:\n\n        ```svelte\n        <!-- Apply the transition to a div -->\n        <div transition:flyAndScale={{ y: -20, duration: 300 }}>\n            Content to animate\n        </div>\n        ```\n\n## Dependencies\n*   `clsx`: For conditionally joining class names.\n*   `tailwind-merge`: For merging Tailwind CSS classes and resolving conflicts.\n*   `svelte/easing`: For smooth animation easing (specifically, `cubicOut`).\n\n## Code Highlights\n*   The `cn` function efficiently combines class name utilities for cleaner code.\n*   The `flyAndScale` function uses `scaleConversion` to map the transition's progress (0 to 1) to the desired `y`, `x`, and `scale` values, creating a smooth animation.\n*   The `styleToString` helper function converts a JavaScript style object into a CSS string, which is necessary for Svelte transitions.\n\n## Detailed Documentation\n\n### cn Function\nThe `cn` function simplifies the process of applying CSS classes conditionally. It leverages `clsx` to handle various input types (strings, objects, arrays) and `tailwind-merge` to resolve any conflicting Tailwind CSS classes, ensuring a consistent and predictable styling outcome.\n\n### flyAndScale Transition\nThe `flyAndScale` transition provides an elegant way to introduce elements into the DOM with a smooth flying and scaling effect. It calculates the intermediate `y`, `x`, and `scale` values based on the transition's progress, using the `cubicOut` easing function for a natural feel. The `scaleConversion` function is a key part of this, mapping the transition's time (0 to 1) to the desired animation range for each property.\n\n#### Customizing the Transition\nYou can customize the animation by adjusting the `params` object. For example, you can change the starting position, scale, and duration of the animation to fit your specific design needs.\n\n#### How it Works\nThe transition function returns an object that Svelte uses to animate the element. The `css` function is called repeatedly during the transition, with `t` representing the progress of the animation (a value between 0 and 1). The function calculates the `y`, `x`, and `scale` values based on `t` and applies them to the element's `transform` style. The `opacity` is also set to `t`, so the element fades in as it flies and scales."

It's commonly used to fetch data or, in this case, to perform a redirect.\n\n**Usage:**\n\nWhen a user visits the root URL of the application (e.g., `/`), this `load` function will execute on the server. It will:\n\n1.  Get the current date.\n2.  Extract the year and month from the date.\n3.  Construct a new URL path in the format `/{year}/{month}` (e.g., `/2024/10`).\n4.  Use the `redirect` function to send an HTTP 307 (Temporary Redirect) response to the browser, instructing it to navigate to the new URL.\n\n**Example:**\n\nIf the current date is October 26, 2024, the user will be redirected to `/2024/10`.\n\n**Notes:**\n\n*   The `307` status code indicates a temporary redirect, meaning the client should continue to use the original URL for future requests.  A 303 status code could also be appropriate depending on the desired behavior.\n*   The `padStart(2, '0')` method is used to ensure that the month is always represented with two digits. For example, January is represented as '01' instead of '1'. This is important for maintaining a consistent URL structure.\n*   This code assumes that the application has routes defined for each year and month (e.g., `/[year]/[month]/+page.svelte`)."

It handles the incoming GET request and orchestrates the retrieval of user data and time entries.\n\n```javascript\nexport async function GET() {\n  try {\n    // Fetch user data from Clockify\n    const userData = await apiRequest('/user');\n    console.log('User Data:', userData);\n\n    // Extract userId and workspaceId from the response\n    const userId = userData.id;\n    const workspaceId = userData.activeWorkspace;\n\n    // Use the userId and workspaceId to fetch time entries\n    const timeEntries = await apiRequest(`/workspaces/${workspaceId}/user/${userId}/time-entries`);\n    console.log('Time Entries:', timeEntries);\n\n    // Return the combined data\n    return json({ user: userData, timeEntries });\n  } catch (e) {\n    console.error('API Error:', e);\n    throw error(500, 'Failed to fetch user data');\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1.  **Fetch User Data:** The `apiRequest('/user')` function is called to fetch the user's data from Clockify. The response is stored in the `userData` variable.\n2.  **Extract User and Workspace IDs:** The `userId` and `workspaceId` are extracted from the `userData` object.\n3.  **Fetch Time Entries:** The `apiRequest` function is called again to fetch the user's time entries from Clockify. The URL is constructed using the `workspaceId` and `userId`. The response is stored in the `timeEntries` variable.\n4.  **Return JSON Response:** The `json()` function from `@sveltejs/kit` is used to create a JSON response containing the `userData` and `timeEntries`.\n5.  **Error Handling:** If any error occurs during the process, the `catch` block will catch the error, log it to the console, and throw an error response with a 500 status code and a message indicating that the user data could not be fetched.\n\n### apiRequest(path) Function\n\nThis function is responsible for making API requests to the Clockify service. It handles authentication and request formatting.  See `$lib/server/api.js` for its implementation details.\n\n### Error Handling\n\nIf any error occurs during the API requests, the code will catch the error and throw an error response with a 500 status code and a message indicating that the user data could not be fetched. This will provide a clear indication to the client-side application that something went wrong during the API request.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\nTo use this API endpoint, you can send a GET request to `/api/time-entries`. The response will be a JSON object containing the user's data and their time entries.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"user\": {\n    \"id\": \"user-id\",\n    \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n    \"email\": \"john.doe@example.com\",\n    \"activeWorkspace\": \"workspace-id\",\n    // ... other user data\n  },\n  \"timeEntries\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"time-entry-1\",\n      \"description\": \"Working on project A\",\n      \"timeInterval\": {\n        \"start\": \"2024-01-01T09:00:00Z\",\n        \"end\": \"2024-01-01T17:00:00Z\"\n      },\n      // ... other time entry data\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"time-entry-2\",\n      \"description\": \"Meeting with client\",\n      \"timeInterval\": {\n        \"start\": \"2024-01-02T10:00:00Z\",\n        \"end\": \"2024-01-02T11:00:00Z\"\n      },\n      // ... other time entry data\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"

It receives an object `params` containing the values extracted from the URL.\n\n#### Parameters:\n\n*   `{ params }`: An object containing the route parameters. In this case, `params.year` and `params.month` represent the year and month extracted from the URL.\n\n#### Functionality:\n\n1.  **Parameter Extraction:** The function first extracts the `year` and `month` parameters from the `params` object.\n2.  **Type Conversion:** It then uses `parseInt` to convert these parameters from strings to integers.\n3.  **Validation:** The code validates that both `year` and `month` are valid numbers and that the `month` is within the range of 1 to 12. If any of these conditions are not met, it throws a 404 error with the message 'Invalid date'.\n4.  **Return Value:** If the parameters are valid, the function returns an object containing the `year` and `month`. This data is then available to the Svelte component for rendering.\n\n#### Example Usage:\n\nIf a user navigates to `/2023/10`, the `load` function will receive `params = { year: '2023', month: '10' }`. It will then convert these to integers, validate them, and return `{ year: 2023, month: 10 }`. This data can then be used in the corresponding `+page.svelte` file to display information for October 2023.\n\n#### Error Handling:\n\nIf a user navigates to `/invalid/date` or `/2023/13`, the `load` function will throw a 404 error, indicating that the requested resource (a valid date) was not found. This prevents the application from proceeding with invalid data and provides a better user experience.\n\n#### Notes:\n\n*   This code assumes that the `[year]` and `[month]` segments of the URL are intended to represent a year and a month, respectively.  It's important to maintain this convention throughout the application.\n*   The `load` function runs on the server, so it can safely access environment variables and perform other server-side operations.\n*   Consider adding more robust validation, such as checking for a reasonable year range, depending on the application's requirements."

It also defines screen breakpoints for responsive design.\n\n    ```javascript\n    container: {\n        center: true,\n        padding: \"2rem\",\n        screens: {\n            \"2xl\": \"1400px\"\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This sets up a container that's centered on the page, has `2rem` of padding, and uses a `2xl` breakpoint at `1400px`.\n*   **theme.extend.colors**: Extends Tailwind's default color palette with custom colors. The colors are defined using the `oklch` color format.\n\n    ```javascript\n    colors: {\n        border: \"oklch(var(--border))\",\n        input: \"oklch(var(--input))\",\n        // ... other colors\n    }\n    ```\n\n    `oklch` provides a perceptually uniform color space, making color adjustments more predictable. The values are likely CSS variables defined elsewhere.\n*   **theme.extend.borderRadius**: Extends the default border radius scale with custom values.\n\n    ```javascript\n    borderRadius: {\n        lg: \"var(--radius)\",\n        md: \"calc(var(--radius) - 2px)\",\n        sm: \"calc(var(--radius) - 4px)\"\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This defines `lg`, `md`, and `sm` border radius sizes based on a CSS variable `--radius`.\n*   **theme.extend.fontFamily**: Extends the default font family configuration with custom font families.\n\n    ```javascript\n    fontFamily: {\n        sans: [...fontFamily.sans],\n        se: [\"Special Elite\", \"serif\"],\n        georama: [\"Georama Variable\", ...fontFamily.sans]\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This adds `Special Elite` and `Georama Variable` fonts to the available font families. `fontFamily.sans` is the default sans-serif font from Tailwind.\n\n## Dependencies\n*   **tailwindcss**: The core Tailwind CSS framework.\n*   **tailwindcss/defaultTheme**: Provides access to the default Tailwind CSS theme values.\n*   **./src/lib/themes.json**: A local JSON file containing theme definitions, likely for light and dark mode.\n\n## Code Highlights\n*   **OKLCH Color Format**: The use of `oklch` for defining colors is a modern approach, offering better perceptual uniformity compared to traditional color formats like `hex` or `rgb`.\n*   **Theme Extension**: The `extend` property is used to add custom styles without overriding Tailwind's defaults, ensuring compatibility and maintainability.\n*   **CSS Variables**: The configuration relies heavily on CSS variables (e.g., `var(--border)`), allowing for dynamic theme switching and easier customization.\n*   **Safelist for Dark Mode**: The `safelist` ensures that the `dark` class is always included, which is crucial for enabling dark mode functionality.\n\n## Detailed Documentation\nThis `tailwind.config.js` file is the heart of the project's design system. By customizing the theme, you can control the look and feel of every component. The `content` setting is critical for performance, as it tells Tailwind which files to scan for used classes, allowing it to remove unused styles and reduce the final CSS bundle size. The `extend` property is your friend when you want to add custom styles without clashing with Tailwind's defaults. Remember to use CSS variables for values that might change based on the theme, such as colors and spacing. Finally, always test your changes thoroughly to ensure they work as expected in both light and dark modes."

It aims to provide a consistent and customizable color scheme for a website or application.\n\n## Purpose\nThe main purpose is to establish a design system's color palette, allowing for easy theme switching (light/dark) and customization of UI elements' colors.\n\n## Key Components\n*   `:root`: Defines the default (light) theme color variables.\n*   `.dark`: Defines the color variables for the dark theme, overriding the `:root` variables when the `.dark` class is applied to the `<html>` or `<body>` element.\n\n## Dependencies\n*   None. This code relies on native CSS features.\n\n## Code Highlights\n*   **OKLCH Color Space:** Uses OKLCH for defining colors, which offers better perceptual uniformity compared to traditional color spaces like RGB or HSL. This means that changes in color values are more consistent with how humans perceive color changes.\n*   **CSS Variables (Custom Properties):** Employs CSS variables to store color values, making it easy to update and maintain the color scheme throughout the application.\n*   **Theme Switching:** Provides a `.dark` class to switch to a dark theme by overriding the default color variables defined in `:root`.\n\n## Detailed Documentation\n\n### `:root`\nThis selector defines the color variables for the default (light) theme. Each variable represents a specific UI element or color role.\n\n```css\n:root {\n    --background: oklch(0.9867722513083308 0.007726150414683134 57.16411036791916); /* Background color */\n    --foreground: oklch(0.05192422197093438 0.012524356737942145 57.16411036791916); /* Text color */\n    --card: oklch(0.9376659163659882 0.037888785839713675 57.16411036791916);       /* Card background color */\n    /* ... other color variables ... */\n    --radius: 0.5rem;                                                                 /* Border radius */\n}\n```\n\n*   `--background`:  The main background color of the application.\n*   `--foreground`: The primary text color.\n*   `--card`: Background color for card-like components.\n*   `--card-foreground`: Text color within cards.\n*   `--popover`: Background color for popover elements.\n*   `--popover-foreground`: Text color within popovers.\n*   `--muted`: A subtle background color, often used for less prominent UI elements.\n*   `--muted-foreground`: Text color for muted elements.\n*   `--primary`: The main brand color.\n*   `--primary-foreground`: Text color that contrasts well with the primary color.\n*   `--secondary`: A secondary brand color.\n*   `--secondary-foreground`: Text color that contrasts well with the secondary color.\n*   `--accent`: An accent color for highlighting elements.\n*   `--accent-foreground`: Text color that contrasts well with the accent color.\n*   `--destructive`: Color used for destructive actions (e.g., delete buttons).\n*   `--destructive-foreground`: Text color that contrasts well with the destructive color.\n*   `--border`: Color for borders and dividers.\n*   `--input`: Background color for input fields.\n*   `--ring`: Color for focus rings around interactive elements.\n*    `--sidebar-background`: Background color for sidebar.\n*    `--sidebar-foreground`: Text color for sidebar.\n*    `--sidebar-primary`: Primary color for sidebar elements.\n*    `--sidebar-primary-foreground`: Text color that contrasts well with the sidebar primary color.\n*    `--sidebar-accent`: Accent color for sidebar elements.\n*    `--sidebar-accent-foreground`: Text color that contrasts well with the sidebar accent color.\n*    `--sidebar-border`: Border color for sidebar elements.\n*    `--sidebar-ring`: Ring color for sidebar elements.\n*   `--chart-1` to `--chart-5`: Colors specifically intended for use in charts, providing a distinct palette.\n*   `--radius`: A global border-radius value used throughout the UI.\n\n\n### `.dark`\nThis class overrides the color variables defined in `:root` to create a dark theme. To enable the dark theme, add the `.dark` class to the `<html>` or `<body>` element.\n\n```css\n.dark {\n    --background: oklch(0.1804282177488298 0.04357922229563975 57.16411036791916); /* Dark theme background color */\n    --foreground: oklch(0.7925321287085163 0.14175556363745362 57.16411036791916); /* Dark theme text color */\n    --card: oklch(0.09357056484738491 0.02259342477068555 57.16411036791916);       /* Dark theme card background color */\n    /* ... other color variables ... */\n}\n```\n\n### OKLCH Color Format\nOKLCH stands for: Oklab Lightness, Chroma, and Hue. It's a color space designed for better perceptual uniformity. The format is:\n\n`oklch(L C H)`\n\n*   `L`: Lightness (0-1, where 0 is black and 1 is white).\n*   `C`: Chroma (roughly, saturation; 0 for grayscale, higher values for more colorful).\n*   `H`: Hue (angle in degrees, 0-360, representing the color wheel).\n\n### Usage\n\n1.  **Include the CSS file:**  Make sure this CSS file is included in your project.\n2.  **Use the variables:**  Use the CSS variables in your component styles.\n\n    ```css\n    body {\n        background-color: var(--background);\n        color: var(--foreground);\n    }\n\n    .card {\n        background-color: var(--card);\n        color: var(--card-foreground);\n        border: 1px solid var(--border);\n        border-radius: var(--radius);\n    }\n    ```\n\n3.  **Theme Switching:**  Add or remove the `.dark` class from the `<html>` or `<body>` element to switch between light and dark themes.\n\n    ```html\n    <html class=\"dark\">\n    <!-- Or -->\n    <body class=\"dark\"></body>\n    </html>\n    ```\n\nThis will apply the dark theme styles.\n"

      "documentation": "## vite.config.js\n\n### Summary\nThis file is the heart of your Vite configuration for a SvelteKit project. It tells Vite how to build and serve your application.\n\n### Purpose\nThe primary goal is to configure Vite to work seamlessly with SvelteKit. This includes handling Svelte components, routing, and other SvelteKit-specific features during development and when building for production.\n\n### Key Components\n*   **`defineConfig`**: This function from the `vite` package is used to define the Vite configuration object. It provides type checking and autocompletion for your configuration, making it easier to set up your project.\n\n    *   Example:\n        ```javascript\n        export default defineConfig({\n          // Configuration options here\n        });\n        ```\n*   **`sveltekit()`**: This is a Vite plugin provided by `@sveltejs/kit/vite`. It's the magic that allows Vite to understand and process SvelteKit-specific files and configurations. It handles things like routing, server-side rendering, and more.\n\n    *   Usage:\n        ```javascript\n        import { sveltekit } from '@sveltejs/kit/vite';\n\n        export default defineConfig({\n          plugins: [sveltekit()]\n        });\n        ```\n\n### Dependencies\n*   **`vite`**: The core Vite library. This provides the `defineConfig` function and the overall build tool.\n*   **`@sveltejs/kit/vite`**: The official SvelteKit Vite plugin. This is essential for integrating SvelteKit into the Vite build process.\n\n### Code Highlights\nThe code demonstrates a clean and concise way to configure Vite for a SvelteKit project. By using `defineConfig`, you get type safety and autocompletion. The `sveltekit()` plugin handles most of the SvelteKit-specific configuration, so you don't have to worry about the nitty-gritty details.\n\n### Detailed Documentation\n\n1.  **Import Statements**:\n\n    *   `import { sveltekit } from '@sveltejs/kit/vite';`: This line imports the `sveltekit` plugin from the `@sveltejs/kit/vite` package. This plugin is crucial for SvelteKit integration.\n    *   `import { defineConfig } from 'vite';`: This line imports the `defineConfig` function from the `vite` package. This function is used to define the Vite configuration object.\n\n2.  **`defineConfig` Function**:\n\n    *   `export default defineConfig({ ... });`: This line exports the default configuration object for Vite. The `defineConfig` function is used to create this object, providing type checking and autocompletion.\n\n3.  **`plugins` Array**:\n\n    *   `plugins: [sveltekit()]`: This array specifies the Vite plugins to use. In this case, it includes the `sveltekit()` plugin, which integrates SvelteKit with Vite.  You can add other Vite plugins here as needed for your project (e.g., for image optimization, environment variable handling, etc.).\n\n**Usage Notes**:\n\n*   This configuration is a starting point. You can customize it further by adding more options to the `defineConfig` object. Refer to the Vite and SvelteKit documentation for available options.\n*   Make sure you have installed the dependencies (`vite` and `@sveltejs/kit/vite`) using npm or yarn before running Vite.\n*   To extend this configuration, you might add other plugins for tasks like image optimization, environment variable handling, or custom build steps.  Each plugin would be added as an element in the `plugins` array.\n"
