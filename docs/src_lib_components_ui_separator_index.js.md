# index.js

## Summary
This code exports the `Root` component from the `separator.svelte` file, providing a simple way to include a separator in Svelte applications. It also exports `Root` again as `Separator` for convenience and potential compatibility.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this code is to make the separator component easily accessible for use in other parts of the application. It acts as a central point for importing the separator, ensuring consistency across the project.

## Key Components
- Root: This is the main separator component, likely implemented as a Svelte component in `separator.svelte`. It handles the rendering and styling of the separator.

## Dependencies
- separator.svelte: This file contains the actual implementation of the separator component.

## Code Highlights
This code utilizes a simple export pattern to expose the `Root` component with two different names. This can be useful for providing flexibility to developers using the component, allowing them to choose the name that best fits their coding style or project conventions.

## Detailed Documentation
This module exports the `Root` component from `separator.svelte`. It also re-exports `Root` as `Separator`. 

Usage:

To use the separator component, import either `Root` or `Separator` from this module:

```javascript
import { Root as Separator } from './separator';

// or
import { Separator } from './separator';
```

Then, you can use the `Separator` component in your Svelte templates:

```svelte
<Separator />
```

This will render a visual separator element, the specific appearance of which is defined within `separator.svelte`.
