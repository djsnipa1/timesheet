# +server.js

## Summary
This code defines an API endpoint that fetches user data and time entries from Clockify. It uses the SvelteKit framework to handle the API request and returns a JSON response containing the user's information and their time entries.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this code is to provide a server-side API endpoint that retrieves and combines user data and time entries from Clockify. This endpoint can be used by the client-side application to display user-specific time tracking information.

## Key Components
- GET(): This asynchronous function handles the incoming GET request to the /api/time-entries endpoint. It fetches user data and time entries from Clockify and returns them as a JSON response.
- apiRequest(path): This function (imported from '$lib/server/api.js') is used to make API requests to the Clockify service. It handles authentication and request formatting.
- error(status, message): This function (imported from '@sveltejs/kit') is used to create and throw an error response if the API request fails.

## Dependencies
- @sveltejs/kit
- $lib/server/api.js

## Code Highlights
The code demonstrates the use of asynchronous JavaScript (async/await) to handle API requests. It also showcases error handling using try/catch blocks and the SvelteKit error function. The code effectively chains API requests, using the result of the first request (user data) to construct the URL for the second request (time entries).

## Summary
This code defines a GET API endpoint using SvelteKit to retrieve user data and time entries from Clockify and return them as a JSON response.

## Purpose
The purpose of this code is to provide a server-side API endpoint that fetches and combines user data and time entries from Clockify. This endpoint is intended to be consumed by a client-side application to display user-specific time tracking information.

## Key Components
*   **GET():** This asynchronous function handles the incoming GET request to the `/api/time-entries` endpoint.
    *   It fetches user data and time entries from Clockify.
    *   It returns a JSON response containing the user's information and their time entries.
*   **apiRequest(path):** This function (imported from `$lib/server/api.js`) is used to make API requests to the Clockify service.
    *   It handles authentication and request formatting.
    *   It takes the API endpoint path as an argument.
*   **error(status, message):** This function (imported from `@sveltejs/kit`) is used to create and throw an error response if the API request fails.
    *   It takes the HTTP status code and error message as arguments.

## Dependencies
*   `@sveltejs/kit`: SvelteKit framework for building web applications.
*   `$lib/server/api.js`: Custom module for making API requests to Clockify.

## Code Highlights
*   **Asynchronous JavaScript (async/await):** The code uses `async/await` to handle API requests, making the code more readable and easier to follow.
*   **Error Handling:** The code uses `try/catch` blocks to handle potential errors during API requests and returns an appropriate error response using the `error` function from `@sveltejs/kit`.
*   **Chained API Requests:** The code effectively chains API requests, using the result of the first request (user data) to construct the URL for the second request (time entries).

### GET() Function

This function is the main entry point for the API endpoint. It handles the incoming GET request and orchestrates the retrieval of user data and time entries.

```javascript
export async function GET() {
  try {
    // Fetch user data from Clockify
    const userData = await apiRequest('/user');
    console.log('User Data:', userData);

    // Extract userId and workspaceId from the response
    const userId = userData.id;
    const workspaceId = userData.activeWorkspace;

    // Use the userId and workspaceId to fetch time entries
    const timeEntries = await apiRequest(`/workspaces/${workspaceId}/user/${userId}/time-entries`);
    console.log('Time Entries:', timeEntries);

    // Return the combined data
    return json({ user: userData, timeEntries });
  } catch (e) {
    console.error('API Error:', e);
    throw error(500, 'Failed to fetch user data');
  }
}
```

**Steps:**

1.  **Fetch User Data:** The `apiRequest('/user')` function is called to fetch the user's data from Clockify. The response is stored in the `userData` variable.
2.  **Extract User and Workspace IDs:** The `userId` and `workspaceId` are extracted from the `userData` object.
3.  **Fetch Time Entries:** The `apiRequest` function is called again to fetch the user's time entries from Clockify. The URL is constructed using the `workspaceId` and `userId`. The response is stored in the `timeEntries` variable.
4.  **Return JSON Response:** The `json()` function from `@sveltejs/kit` is used to create a JSON response containing the `userData` and `timeEntries`.
5.  **Error Handling:** If any error occurs during the process, the `catch` block will catch the error, log it to the console, and throw an error response with a 500 status code and a message indicating that the user data could not be fetched.

### apiRequest(path) Function

This function is responsible for making API requests to the Clockify service. It handles authentication and request formatting.  See `$lib/server/api.js` for its implementation details.

### Error Handling

If any error occurs during the API requests, the code will catch the error and throw an error response with a 500 status code and a message indicating that the user data could not be fetched. This will provide a clear indication to the client-side application that something went wrong during the API request.

**Example Usage:**

To use this API endpoint, you can send a GET request to `/api/time-entries`. The response will be a JSON object containing the user's data and their time entries.

```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": "user-id",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "activeWorkspace": "workspace-id",
    // ... other user data
  },
  "timeEntries": [
    {
      "id": "time-entry-1",
      "description": "Working on project A",
      "timeInterval": {
        "start": "2024-01-01T09:00:00Z",
        "end": "2024-01-01T17:00:00Z"
      },
      // ... other time entry data
    },
    {
      "id": "time-entry-2",
      "description": "Meeting with client",
      "timeInterval": {
        "start": "2024-01-02T10:00:00Z",
        "end": "2024-01-02T11:00:00Z"
      },
      // ... other time entry data
    }
  ]
}
```
