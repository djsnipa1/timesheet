# index.js

## Summary
This code exports the `Root` component from the `input.svelte` file, aliasing it as both `Root` and `Input`. This provides a simple way to import and use the input component in other parts of the application.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this code is to make the `Root` component (likely an input field component) easily accessible for use in other modules. It acts as a central export point, allowing developers to import the component using either `Root` or `Input` as the name.

## Key Components
- Root: The main input component, likely implemented using Svelte. It handles user input and related functionality.
- Input: An alias for the Root component, providing an alternative name for importing the same component.

## Dependencies
- input.svelte: This file contains the actual implementation of the Root component, presumably using Svelte's syntax and features.

## Code Highlights
The code demonstrates a simple export pattern, making a component available under multiple names. This can improve code readability and provide flexibility for developers using the component.

## Detailed Documentation
This module exports the `Root` component from `input.svelte`. It also provides an alias, `Input`, for the same component. 

**Usage:**

To use the input component in another file, you can import it as follows:

```javascript
import { Root } from './input';
// or
import { Input } from './input';

// Then use the component in your Svelte template:
<Root />
// or
<Input />
```

Both `Root` and `Input` will refer to the same component. Choose the import name that best suits your coding style and the context of your project.
