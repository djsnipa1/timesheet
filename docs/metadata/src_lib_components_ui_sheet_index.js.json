  "summary": "This code defines a Sheet component using Svelte and Tailwind CSS. It provides a flexible and accessible way to display content in a panel that slides in from the side, top, or bottom of the screen, similar to a drawer or off-canvas menu.",
  "purpose": "The primary purpose of this code is to create a reusable Sheet component that can be easily integrated into Svelte applications. It handles the structure, styling, and animation of the sheet, allowing developers to focus on the content within the sheet.",
  "key_components": [
    "Root: The main component that wraps the entire sheet. It's based on the Dialog primitive from 'bits-ui'.",
    "Close: A button that closes the sheet.",
    "Trigger: A button or element that opens the sheet.",
    "Portal: A component that renders the sheet content in a separate DOM node, typically at the end of the `<body>` element. This helps with z-index and stacking issues.",
    "Overlay: A semi-transparent layer that covers the rest of the screen when the sheet is open, providing visual focus on the sheet.",
    "Content: The container for the sheet's content.",
    "Header: A component for the sheet's header, typically containing a title and close button.",
    "Footer: A component for the sheet's footer, typically containing action buttons.",
    "Title: A component for the sheet's title.",
    "Description: A component for the sheet's description or subtitle.",
    "sheetVariants: A Tailwind Variants configuration for styling the sheet based on its side (top, bottom, left, right).",
    "sheetTransitions: Defines the slide-in and slide-out animations for the sheet based on its side."

  "dependencies": [
    "bits-ui: A UI component library providing the Dialog primitive.",
    "tailwind-variants: A utility for creating reusable component variants with Tailwind CSS.",
    "Svelte: A JavaScript compiler that turns your declarative components into efficient JavaScript that surgically updates the DOM."
  ],
  "code_highlights": "The code utilizes the 'bits-ui' Dialog primitive for accessibility and basic sheet functionality. It leverages 'tailwind-variants' to create a flexible styling system based on the sheet's side. The use of Svelte components (Portal, Overlay, Content, etc.) promotes modularity and reusability. The 'sheetTransitions' object defines custom animations for different sheet positions, enhancing the user experience.",
  "documentation": "This code defines a Sheet component in Svelte, offering a versatile way to present content in a sliding panel. Let's break down how to use it:\n\n**Basic Usage:**\n\n1.  **Import the components:**\n\n    ```javascript\n    import { Sheet, SheetTrigger, SheetContent, SheetHeader, SheetTitle, SheetDescription, SheetClose } from '$lib/components/ui/sheet';\n    ```\n\n2.  **Implement the Sheet:**\n\n    ```svelte\n    <Sheet>\n      <SheetTrigger>Open Sheet</SheetTrigger>\n      <SheetContent side=\"right\">\n        <SheetHeader>\n          <SheetTitle>Profile</SheetTitle>\n          <SheetDescription>\n            Make changes to your profile here. Click save when you're done.\n          </SheetDescription>\n        </SheetHeader>\n        <!-- Sheet content goes here -->\n        <SheetClose>Close</SheetClose>\n      </SheetContent>\n    </Sheet>\n    ```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   `Sheet`: The main wrapper component.\n*   `SheetTrigger`: The element that, when clicked, opens the sheet.  It uses the `bits-ui` Dialog.Trigger under the hood.\n*   `SheetContent`:  The container for the sheet's content. The `side` prop determines which side of the screen the sheet slides in from (top, bottom, left, right).  Defaults to `right`.\n*   `SheetHeader`: An optional header for the sheet, typically containing a title and description.\n*   `SheetTitle`: The title of the sheet.\n*   `SheetDescription`: A description or subtitle for the sheet.\n*   `SheetClose`: A button that closes the sheet. It uses the `bits-ui` Dialog.Close under the hood.\n\n**Customization:**\n\n*   **Side:** Use the `side` prop on `SheetContent` to control the sheet's position.  Example: `<SheetContent side=\"left\">`.\n*   **Styling:**  The `sheetVariants` object provides a base style and variants for different sides. You can extend or override these styles using Tailwind CSS classes.\n*   **Transitions:** The `sheetTransitions` object defines the animations.  You can customize these animations to fit your design.\n\n**Accessibility:**\n\nThe Sheet component is built with accessibility in mind, leveraging the `bits-ui` Dialog primitive. This includes proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation.\n\n**Example with custom styling:**\n\n```svelte\n<Sheet>\n  <SheetTrigger class=\"bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded\">Open Sheet</SheetTrigger>\n  <SheetContent side=\"bottom\" class=\"sm:max-w-md\">\n    <SheetHeader>\n      <SheetTitle>Terms of Service</SheetTitle>\n    </SheetHeader>\n    <!-- Terms of service content -->\n    <SheetClose class=\"absolute top-4 right-4\">Close</SheetClose>\n  </SheetContent>\n</Sheet>\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates how to add custom Tailwind CSS classes to the trigger button and the sheet content to modify their appearance.\n"
