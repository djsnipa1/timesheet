It simplifies making authenticated API requests by automatically adding necessary headers, such as the API key, and handling basic error checking.\n\n### Function: `fetchWithAuth`\n\n#### Purpose\nThe `fetchWithAuth` function is designed to streamline API calls within the application. It ensures that all requests are properly authenticated and that errors are handled consistently.\n\n#### Parameters\n*   `endpoint` (string): The API endpoint to which the request is made (e.g., `/users`, `/products`). This will be appended to the `API_BASE_URL`.\n*   `options` (object, optional): An object containing request options, such as `method` (e.g., 'GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE'), `body`, and any custom `headers`.  Defaults to an empty object.\n\n#### Returns\n*   A Promise that resolves to the JSON response from the API if the request is successful.\n\n#### Throws\n*   An Error object if the API call fails (i.e., the response status is not ok).\n\n#### Usage\n\n```javascript\nimport { fetchWithAuth } from './api.js';\n\nasync function getData() {\n  try {\n    const data = await fetchWithAuth('/data', {\n      method: 'GET',\n      headers: {\n        'Custom-Header': 'CustomValue'\n      }\n    });\n    console.log(data);\n    return data;\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);\n    throw error; // Re-throw to allow calling functions to handle the error as well\n  }\n}\n\n// Example of a POST request\nasync function postData(payload) {\n    try {\n        const response = await fetchWithAuth('/items', {\n            method: 'POST',\n            headers: {\n                'Content-Type': 'application/json'\n            },\n            body: JSON.stringify(payload)\n        });\n        console.log('Success:', response);\n        return response;\n    } catch (error) {\n        console.error('Error posting data:', error);\n        throw error;\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\n#### Details\n\n1.  **API Base URL:** The `API_BASE_URL` constant defines the base URL for all API requests.  It's assumed this is defined elsewhere (e.g., at the top of the `api.js` file).\n2.  **Headers:** The function automatically adds the `X-Api-Key` header using the value from the `VITE_CLOCKIFY_API_KEY` environment variable. It also sets the `Content-Type` to `application/json` by default.  Any headers provided in the `options` parameter will override these defaults.\n3.  **Error Handling:** If the API response has a status code that indicates an error (i.e., `response.ok` is false), the function throws an error with a descriptive message.\n4. **Environment Variables:** The code relies on `import.meta.env.VITE_CLOCKIFY_API_KEY` to access the API key. Ensure that this environment variable is properly set in your project's `.env` file or environment configuration.\n"
