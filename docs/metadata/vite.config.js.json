  "documentation": "## vite.config.js\n\n### Summary\nThis file is the heart of your Vite configuration for a SvelteKit project. It tells Vite how to build and serve your application.\n\n### Purpose\nThe primary goal is to configure Vite to work seamlessly with SvelteKit. This includes handling Svelte components, routing, and other SvelteKit-specific features during development and when building for production.\n\n### Key Components\n*   **`defineConfig`**: This function from the `vite` package is used to define the Vite configuration object. It provides type checking and autocompletion for your configuration, making it easier to set up your project.\n\n    *   Example:\n        ```javascript\n        export default defineConfig({\n          // Configuration options here\n        });\n        ```\n*   **`sveltekit()`**: This is a Vite plugin provided by `@sveltejs/kit/vite`. It's the magic that allows Vite to understand and process SvelteKit-specific files and configurations. It handles things like routing, server-side rendering, and more.\n\n    *   Usage:\n        ```javascript\n        import { sveltekit } from '@sveltejs/kit/vite';\n\n        export default defineConfig({\n          plugins: [sveltekit()]\n        });\n        ```\n\n### Dependencies\n*   **`vite`**: The core Vite library. This provides the `defineConfig` function and the overall build tool.\n*   **`@sveltejs/kit/vite`**: The official SvelteKit Vite plugin. This is essential for integrating SvelteKit into the Vite build process.\n\n### Code Highlights\nThe code demonstrates a clean and concise way to configure Vite for a SvelteKit project. By using `defineConfig`, you get type safety and autocompletion. The `sveltekit()` plugin handles most of the SvelteKit-specific configuration, so you don't have to worry about the nitty-gritty details.\n\n### Detailed Documentation\n\n1.  **Import Statements**:\n\n    *   `import { sveltekit } from '@sveltejs/kit/vite';`: This line imports the `sveltekit` plugin from the `@sveltejs/kit/vite` package. This plugin is crucial for SvelteKit integration.\n    *   `import { defineConfig } from 'vite';`: This line imports the `defineConfig` function from the `vite` package. This function is used to define the Vite configuration object.\n\n2.  **`defineConfig` Function**:\n\n    *   `export default defineConfig({ ... });`: This line exports the default configuration object for Vite. The `defineConfig` function is used to create this object, providing type checking and autocompletion.\n\n3.  **`plugins` Array**:\n\n    *   `plugins: [sveltekit()]`: This array specifies the Vite plugins to use. In this case, it includes the `sveltekit()` plugin, which integrates SvelteKit with Vite.  You can add other Vite plugins here as needed for your project (e.g., for image optimization, environment variable handling, etc.).\n\n**Usage Notes**:\n\n*   This configuration is a starting point. You can customize it further by adding more options to the `defineConfig` object. Refer to the Vite and SvelteKit documentation for available options.\n*   Make sure you have installed the dependencies (`vite` and `@sveltejs/kit/vite`) using npm or yarn before running Vite.\n*   To extend this configuration, you might add other plugins for tasks like image optimization, environment variable handling, or custom build steps.  Each plugin would be added as an element in the `plugins` array.\n"
