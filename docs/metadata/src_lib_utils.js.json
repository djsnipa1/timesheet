  "documentation": "# src/lib/utils.js\n\n## Summary\nThis file contains utility functions for a Svelte application, focusing on CSS class management and custom transitions.\n\n## Purpose\nThe purpose is to provide reusable tools that simplify common tasks like combining CSS classes and creating engaging animations.\n\n## Key Components\n*   **cn(...inputs)**: A function to conditionally apply CSS class names. It uses `clsx` to handle conditional class names and `tailwind-merge` to resolve conflicts between Tailwind CSS classes.\n\n    *   **Parameters**: Accepts any number of arguments that `clsx` can handle (strings, objects, arrays).\n    *   **Returns**: A string containing the merged and processed class names.\n    *   **Example**:\n\n        ```javascript\n        import { cn } from '$lib/utils';\n\n        // Basic usage\n        const className = cn('bg-blue-500', 'text-white', { 'font-bold': true });\n        // Result: 'bg-blue-500 text-white font-bold'\n        ```\n*   **flyAndScale(node, params = { y: -8, x: 0, start: 0.95, duration: 150 })**: A Svelte transition function that makes an element 'fly' in and scale up as it appears.\n\n    *   **Parameters**:\n        *   `node`: The DOM node to which the transition is applied. (Svelte provides this automatically)\n        *   `params`: (Optional) An object with the following properties:\n            *   `y`: The vertical distance the element flies from (default: -8).\n            *   `x`: The horizontal distance the element flies from (default: 0).\n            *   `start`: The initial scale of the element (default: 0.95).\n            *   `duration`: The duration of the animation in milliseconds (default: 150).\n    *   **Returns**: An object with `duration`, `delay`, `css`, and `easing` properties, as expected by Svelte transitions.\n    *   **Example**:\n\n        ```svelte\n        <!-- Apply the transition to a div -->\n        <div transition:flyAndScale={{ y: -20, duration: 300 }}>\n            Content to animate\n        </div>\n        ```\n\n## Dependencies\n*   `clsx`: For conditionally joining class names.\n*   `tailwind-merge`: For merging Tailwind CSS classes and resolving conflicts.\n*   `svelte/easing`: For smooth animation easing (specifically, `cubicOut`).\n\n## Code Highlights\n*   The `cn` function efficiently combines class name utilities for cleaner code.\n*   The `flyAndScale` function uses `scaleConversion` to map the transition's progress (0 to 1) to the desired `y`, `x`, and `scale` values, creating a smooth animation.\n*   The `styleToString` helper function converts a JavaScript style object into a CSS string, which is necessary for Svelte transitions.\n\n## Detailed Documentation\n\n### cn Function\nThe `cn` function simplifies the process of applying CSS classes conditionally. It leverages `clsx` to handle various input types (strings, objects, arrays) and `tailwind-merge` to resolve any conflicting Tailwind CSS classes, ensuring a consistent and predictable styling outcome.\n\n### flyAndScale Transition\nThe `flyAndScale` transition provides an elegant way to introduce elements into the DOM with a smooth flying and scaling effect. It calculates the intermediate `y`, `x`, and `scale` values based on the transition's progress, using the `cubicOut` easing function for a natural feel. The `scaleConversion` function is a key part of this, mapping the transition's time (0 to 1) to the desired animation range for each property.\n\n#### Customizing the Transition\nYou can customize the animation by adjusting the `params` object. For example, you can change the starting position, scale, and duration of the animation to fit your specific design needs.\n\n#### How it Works\nThe transition function returns an object that Svelte uses to animate the element. The `css` function is called repeatedly during the transition, with `t` representing the progress of the animation (a value between 0 and 1). The function calculates the `y`, `x`, and `scale` values based on `t` and applies them to the element's `transform` style. The `opacity` is also set to `t`, so the element fades in as it flies and scales."
