{
  "summary": "This code exports the `Root` component from the `input.svelte` file, aliasing it as both `Root` and `Input`. This provides a simple way to import and use the input component in other parts of the application.",
  "purpose": "The primary purpose of this code is to make the `Root` component (likely an input field component) easily accessible for use in other modules. It acts as a central export point, allowing developers to import the component using either `Root` or `Input` as the name.",
  "key_components": [
    "Root: The main input component, likely implemented using Svelte. It handles user input and related functionality.",
    "Input: An alias for the Root component, providing an alternative name for importing the same component."
  ],
  "dependencies": [
    "input.svelte: This file contains the actual implementation of the Root component, presumably using Svelte's syntax and features."
  ],
  "code_highlights": "The code demonstrates a simple export pattern, making a component available under multiple names. This can improve code readability and provide flexibility for developers using the component.",
  "documentation": "This module exports the `Root` component from `input.svelte`. It also provides an alias, `Input`, for the same component. \n\n**Usage:**\n\nTo use the input component in another file, you can import it as follows:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Root } from './input';\n// or\nimport { Input } from './input';\n\n// Then use the component in your Svelte template:\n<Root />\n// or\n<Input />\n```\n\nBoth `Root` and `Input` will refer to the same component. Choose the import name that best suits your coding style and the context of your project."
