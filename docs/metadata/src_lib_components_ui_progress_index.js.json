  "summary": "This code exports the `Root` component from `./progress.svelte` and also exports it under the alias `Progress`. It serves as the main entry point for the Progress component in the user interface library.",
  "purpose": "The primary purpose of this code is to make the `Progress` component easily accessible for import and use throughout the larger application. It acts as a central module for exporting the component.",
  "key_components": [
    "Root: The main Svelte component that implements the progress bar functionality. It's imported from './progress.svelte'."
  ],
  "dependencies": [
    "./progress.svelte: This is the internal Svelte component file containing the implementation details of the progress bar."
  ],
  "code_highlights": "This code utilizes a simple export pattern to expose the `Root` component with two different names (`Root` and `Progress`). This provides flexibility for developers using the component, allowing them to choose the import name that best suits their needs or coding style.",
  "documentation": "This module exports the `Progress` component, which is a visual indicator of a process's completion status. To use the component, import it as follows:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Progress } from './path/to/this/module';\n\n// Alternatively, you can import it as Root\nimport { Root } from './path/to/this/module';\n```\n\nThe `Progress` component is implemented in `progress.svelte`, which should contain the component's logic, styling, and markup.  Refer to `progress.svelte` for details on available props and customization options."
