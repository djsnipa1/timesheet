This endpoint is intended to be consumed by a client-side application to display user-specific time tracking information.\n\n## Key Components\n*   **GET():** This asynchronous function handles the incoming GET request to the `/api/time-entries` endpoint.\n    *   It fetches user data and time entries from Clockify.\n    *   It returns a JSON response containing the user's information and their time entries.\n*   **apiRequest(path):** This function (imported from `$lib/server/api.js`) is used to make API requests to the Clockify service.\n    *   It handles authentication and request formatting.\n    *   It takes the API endpoint path as an argument.\n*   **error(status, message):** This function (imported from `@sveltejs/kit`) is used to create and throw an error response if the API request fails.\n    *   It takes the HTTP status code and error message as arguments.\n\n## Dependencies\n*   `@sveltejs/kit`: SvelteKit framework for building web applications.\n*   `$lib/server/api.js`: Custom module for making API requests to Clockify.\n\n## Code Highlights\n*   **Asynchronous JavaScript (async/await):** The code uses `async/await` to handle API requests, making the code more readable and easier to follow.\n*   **Error Handling:** The code uses `try/catch` blocks to handle potential errors during API requests and returns an appropriate error response using the `error` function from `@sveltejs/kit`.\n*   **Chained API Requests:** The code effectively chains API requests, using the result of the first request (user data) to construct the URL for the second request (time entries).\n\n## Detailed Documentation\n\n### GET() Function\n\nThis function is the main entry point for the API endpoint. It handles the incoming GET request and orchestrates the retrieval of user data and time entries.\n\n```javascript\nexport async function GET() {\n  try {\n    // Fetch user data from Clockify\n    const userData = await apiRequest('/user');\n    console.log('User Data:', userData);\n\n    // Extract userId and workspaceId from the response\n    const userId = userData.id;\n    const workspaceId = userData.activeWorkspace;\n\n    // Use the userId and workspaceId to fetch time entries\n    const timeEntries = await apiRequest(`/workspaces/${workspaceId}/user/${userId}/time-entries`);\n    console.log('Time Entries:', timeEntries);\n\n    // Return the combined data\n    return json({ user: userData, timeEntries });\n  } catch (e) {\n    console.error('API Error:', e);\n    throw error(500, 'Failed to fetch user data');\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1.  **Fetch User Data:** The `apiRequest('/user')` function is called to fetch the user's data from Clockify. The response is stored in the `userData` variable.\n2.  **Extract User and Workspace IDs:** The `userId` and `workspaceId` are extracted from the `userData` object.\n3.  **Fetch Time Entries:** The `apiRequest` function is called again to fetch the user's time entries from Clockify. The URL is constructed using the `workspaceId` and `userId`. The response is stored in the `timeEntries` variable.\n4.  **Return JSON Response:** The `json()` function from `@sveltejs/kit` is used to create a JSON response containing the `userData` and `timeEntries`.\n5.  **Error Handling:** If any error occurs during the process, the `catch` block will catch the error, log it to the console, and throw an error response with a 500 status code and a message indicating that the user data could not be fetched.\n\n### apiRequest(path) Function\n\nThis function is responsible for making API requests to the Clockify service. It handles authentication and request formatting.  See `$lib/server/api.js` for its implementation details.\n\n### Error Handling\n\nIf any error occurs during the API requests, the code will catch the error and throw an error response with a 500 status code and a message indicating that the user data could not be fetched. This will provide a clear indication to the client-side application that something went wrong during the API request.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\nTo use this API endpoint, you can send a GET request to `/api/time-entries`. The response will be a JSON object containing the user's data and their time entries.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"user\": {\n    \"id\": \"user-id\",\n    \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n    \"email\": \"john.doe@example.com\",\n    \"activeWorkspace\": \"workspace-id\",\n    // ... other user data\n  },\n  \"timeEntries\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"time-entry-1\",\n      \"description\": \"Working on project A\",\n      \"timeInterval\": {\n        \"start\": \"2024-01-01T09:00:00Z\",\n        \"end\": \"2024-01-01T17:00:00Z\"\n      },\n      // ... other time entry data\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"time-entry-2\",\n      \"description\": \"Meeting with client\",\n      \"timeInterval\": {\n        \"start\": \"2024-01-02T10:00:00Z\",\n        \"end\": \"2024-01-02T11:00:00Z\"\n      },\n      // ... other time entry data\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"
