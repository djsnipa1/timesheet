  "documentation": "# tailwind.config.js\n\n## Summary\nThis file configures Tailwind CSS for the project, defining the design system's core aspects like colors, fonts, and breakpoints. It also handles dark mode setup and specifies which files to scan for Tailwind classes.\n\n## Purpose\nThe main goal is to customize Tailwind CSS to fit the project's specific design needs. This ensures a consistent and maintainable look and feel across all components.\n\n## Key Components\n*   **darkMode**: Enables dark mode using class-based activation (e.g., `<body class=\"dark\">`).\n\n    ```javascript\n    darkMode: [\"class\"]\n    ```\n*   **content**: Specifies which files Tailwind CSS should scan for class names. This is crucial for Tailwind's tree-shaking to remove unused styles.\n\n    ```javascript\n    content: [\"./src/**/*.{html,js,svelte,ts}\"]\n    ```\n\n    This example tells Tailwind to look for class names in all `html`, `js`, `svelte`, and `ts` files within the `src` directory and its subdirectories.\n*   **safelist**: Forces specific class names to be included in the final CSS, even if Tailwind doesn't find them in the content files. This is useful for dynamic class names or classes added via JavaScript.\n\n    ```javascript\n    safelist: [\"dark\"]\n    ```\n\n    Here, the `dark` class is always included, which is essential for dark mode functionality.\n*   **theme.container**: Configures the default container styles, centering content and adding padding. It also defines screen breakpoints for responsive design.\n\n    ```javascript\n    container: {\n        center: true,\n        padding: \"2rem\",\n        screens: {\n            \"2xl\": \"1400px\"\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This sets up a container that's centered on the page, has `2rem` of padding, and uses a `2xl` breakpoint at `1400px`.\n*   **theme.extend.colors**: Extends Tailwind's default color palette with custom colors. The colors are defined using the `oklch` color format.\n\n    ```javascript\n    colors: {\n        border: \"oklch(var(--border))\",\n        input: \"oklch(var(--input))\",\n        // ... other colors\n    }\n    ```\n\n    `oklch` provides a perceptually uniform color space, making color adjustments more predictable. The values are likely CSS variables defined elsewhere.\n*   **theme.extend.borderRadius**: Extends the default border radius scale with custom values.\n\n    ```javascript\n    borderRadius: {\n        lg: \"var(--radius)\",\n        md: \"calc(var(--radius) - 2px)\",\n        sm: \"calc(var(--radius) - 4px)\"\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This defines `lg`, `md`, and `sm` border radius sizes based on a CSS variable `--radius`.\n*   **theme.extend.fontFamily**: Extends the default font family configuration with custom font families.\n\n    ```javascript\n    fontFamily: {\n        sans: [...fontFamily.sans],\n        se: [\"Special Elite\", \"serif\"],\n        georama: [\"Georama Variable\", ...fontFamily.sans]\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This adds `Special Elite` and `Georama Variable` fonts to the available font families. `fontFamily.sans` is the default sans-serif font from Tailwind.\n\n## Dependencies\n*   **tailwindcss**: The core Tailwind CSS framework.\n*   **tailwindcss/defaultTheme**: Provides access to the default Tailwind CSS theme values.\n*   **./src/lib/themes.json**: A local JSON file containing theme definitions, likely for light and dark mode.\n\n## Code Highlights\n*   **OKLCH Color Format**: The use of `oklch` for defining colors is a modern approach, offering better perceptual uniformity compared to traditional color formats like `hex` or `rgb`.\n*   **Theme Extension**: The `extend` property is used to add custom styles without overriding Tailwind's defaults, ensuring compatibility and maintainability.\n*   **CSS Variables**: The configuration relies heavily on CSS variables (e.g., `var(--border)`), allowing for dynamic theme switching and easier customization.\n*   **Safelist for Dark Mode**: The `safelist` ensures that the `dark` class is always included, which is crucial for enabling dark mode functionality.\n\n## Detailed Documentation\nThis `tailwind.config.js` file is the heart of the project's design system. By customizing the theme, you can control the look and feel of every component. The `content` setting is critical for performance, as it tells Tailwind which files to scan for used classes, allowing it to remove unused styles and reduce the final CSS bundle size. The `extend` property is your friend when you want to add custom styles without clashing with Tailwind's defaults. Remember to use CSS variables for values that might change based on the theme, such as colors and spacing. Finally, always test your changes thoroughly to ensure they work as expected in both light and dark modes."
