  "documentation": "This file exports all the components needed to construct a fully functional Pagination UI. To use the Pagination component, import the desired sub-components from this file. For example:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Pagination, PaginationItem, PaginationLink, PrevButton, NextButton } from './pagination';\n```\n\nThen, use these components within your Svelte templates to create the pagination UI. Each component has specific properties that can be configured to customize its appearance and behavior. Refer to the individual component files (e.g., `pagination.svelte`, `pagination-item.svelte`) for detailed information on available properties and usage examples."
