# +server.js

## Summary
This code defines an API endpoint for retrieving user data. It uses SvelteKit's `json` and `error` functions to handle responses and errors, and it calls an `apiRequest` function to fetch the data from a backend API.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this code is to create a server-side route that fetches user data from an external API and returns it as a JSON response. This route is part of the application's API layer, providing a way for the frontend to access user information.

## Key Components
- GET: This asynchronous function handles GET requests to the `/api/user` endpoint. It fetches user data and returns it as a JSON response, or throws an error if the fetch fails.
- apiRequest: This function (imported from `$lib/server/api.js`) is responsible for making the actual API call to retrieve the user data. It encapsulates the logic for handling API requests, such as setting headers and handling different response codes.

## Dependencies
- @sveltejs/kit: Provides `error` and `json` functions for handling responses and errors in SvelteKit routes.
- $lib/server/api.js: A custom module that exports the `apiRequest` function, used for making API calls to the backend.

## Code Highlights
The code demonstrates a common pattern for creating API endpoints in SvelteKit: using `try...catch` blocks to handle potential errors during API calls, and using the `json` function to return data in a structured format. It also showcases the use of a separate module (`$lib/server/api.js`) to encapsulate API request logic, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

## Detailed Documentation
This code defines a GET endpoint at `/api/user`. When a client makes a GET request to this endpoint, the `GET` function is executed. The function first attempts to fetch user data by calling the `apiRequest` function with the `/user` path. If the API call is successful, the returned data is logged to the console and then returned to the client as a JSON response using the `json` function. If the API call fails (e.g., due to a network error or an invalid API key), an error is caught. The error is logged to the console, and an error response with a 500 status code and a message 'Failed to fetch user data' is thrown using the `error` function. 

Example Usage:
To use this endpoint, simply send a GET request to `/api/user`. For example, using `fetch` in JavaScript:

```javascript
fetch('/api/user')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

This will retrieve the user data from the API and log it to the console. If an error occurs, it will be caught and logged as well.
