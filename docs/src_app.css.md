# app.css

## Summary
This CSS code configures the styling for a web application using Tailwind CSS. It defines a set of custom CSS variables for theming, including colors for the background, foreground, cards, and various UI elements, and sets up both light and dark mode color schemes.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this code is to establish a consistent and customizable visual theme for the application. It leverages CSS variables to manage color palettes and applies these variables to the base styles of the application, ensuring a unified look and feel across different components and modes (light and dark).

## Key Components
- :root
- .dark
- @layer base

## Dependencies
- Tailwind CSS

## Code Highlights
The code utilizes CSS variables (custom properties) to define a theming system, allowing for easy modification and switching between light and dark modes. It also leverages Tailwind CSS's `@layer` directive to inject custom styles into Tailwind's base styles, ensuring that the custom styles are applied correctly and consistently.

## Summary
This CSS code configures the styling for a web application using Tailwind CSS. It defines a set of custom CSS variables for theming, including colors for the background, foreground, cards, and various UI elements, and sets up both light and dark mode color schemes.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this code is to establish a consistent and customizable visual theme for the application. It leverages CSS variables to manage color palettes and applies these variables to the base styles of the application, ensuring a unified look and feel across different components and modes (light and dark).

## Key Components
*   `:root`: Defines CSS variables for the default (light) theme.
*   `.dark`: Defines CSS variables for the dark theme, which overrides the default theme when the `dark` class is applied to the `html` element (typically done automatically by Tailwind based on system preferences or user selection).
*   `@layer base`: A Tailwind CSS directive used to inject custom base styles. This ensures that the styles are applied at the correct layer in the CSS cascade, before components and utilities.

## Dependencies
*   Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework used for styling the application. This code relies on Tailwind's base styles, components, and utilities.

## Code Highlights
*   **CSS Variables for Theming:** The code uses CSS variables (custom properties) to define a theming system. This allows for easy modification of the color scheme by simply changing the values of the variables. The use of HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) color values makes it easier to adjust the color scheme.
*   **Dark Mode Support:** The code provides a separate set of CSS variables for the dark theme, allowing the application to switch between light and dark modes seamlessly. The `.dark` class is typically applied to the `html` element using JavaScript or by Tailwind's dark mode variant.
*   **Tailwind CSS `@layer` Directive:** The `@layer base` directive is used to inject custom styles into Tailwind's base styles. This ensures that the custom styles are applied at the correct layer in the CSS cascade, before components and utilities. This is important for ensuring that the custom styles are not overridden by Tailwind's default styles.

### CSS Variables (`:root` and `.dark`)

The code defines a set of CSS variables for theming. These variables are used to control the colors of various UI elements, such as the background, foreground, cards, and buttons.

**Example:**

```css
:root {
  --background: 0.980 0.018 81.314; /* Light background color */
  --foreground: 0.320 0.025 81.314; /* Light foreground color */
  --primary: 0.116 0.022 226.938;   /* Primary color */
}

.dark {
  --background: 0.245 0.006 81.314; /* Dark background color */
  --foreground: 0.933 0.040 81.314; /* Dark foreground color */
  --primary: 0.426 0.071 226.938;   /* Primary color in dark mode */
}
```

These variables are defined within the `:root` selector for the default (light) theme and within the `.dark` selector for the dark theme. The `.dark` selector is typically applied to the `html` element when the user prefers a dark theme.

### Tailwind CSS `@layer` Directive

The `@layer base` directive is used to inject custom styles into Tailwind's base styles. This ensures that the styles are applied at the correct layer in the CSS cascade.

**Example:**

```css
@layer base {
  * {
    @apply border-border; /* Apply border color to all elements */
  }
  body {
    @apply bg-background text-foreground; /* Apply background and text colors to the body */
  }
}
```

In this example, the `@apply` directive is used to apply Tailwind CSS utility classes to the `*` and `body` elements. The `border-border` class applies the border color defined by the `--border` CSS variable, and the `bg-background` and `text-foreground` classes apply the background and text colors defined by the `--background` and `--foreground` CSS variables, respectively.

### Usage Notes
*   To use the CSS variables in your components, you can reference them using the `var()` function. For example, to set the background color of a div to the value of the `--background` variable, you would use the following CSS:

    ```css
    div {
      background-color: hsl(var(--background));
    }
    ```

*   To enable dark mode, you can add the `dark` class to the `html` element. This will cause the CSS variables defined within the `.dark` selector to be applied.

    ```html
    <html class="dark">
    <head>
    ...
    </head>
    <body>
    ...
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

*   Tailwind CSS can automatically apply the `dark` class based on the user's system preferences. To enable this feature, you need to configure the `darkMode` option in your `tailwind.config.js` file.

    ```javascript
    // tailwind.config.js
    module.exports = {
      darkMode: 'media', // or 'class'
      theme: {
        extend: {},
      },
      variants: {},
      plugins: [],
    }
    ```

    Setting `darkMode` to `'media'` will enable dark mode based on the user's system preferences, while setting it to `'class'` will require you to manually add the `dark` class to the `html` element.
