# index.js

## Summary
This code defines a `badgeVariants` function using `tailwind-variants` to create different styles for badge components. It also exports the `Badge` component from './badge.svelte'.

## Purpose
The primary purpose is to provide a set of pre-defined styles for badge components, making it easy to create visually consistent badges throughout the application. It also exports the base `Badge` component.

## Key Components
- badgeVariants: A function that generates different badge styles based on the 'variant' property using tailwind-variants.
- Badge: The base Badge component (likely a Svelte component) that utilizes the defined styles.

## Dependencies
- tailwind-variants: A library for creating reusable component variants with Tailwind CSS.
- ./badge.svelte: The Svelte component file for the base Badge component.

## Code Highlights
The use of `tailwind-variants` allows for a concise and maintainable way to define different badge styles. The `tv` function enables the creation of a component with multiple variants, each with its own set of Tailwind CSS classes. The `defaultVariants` property sets the default style for the badge.

## Detailed Documentation
The `badgeVariants` function is created using `tailwind-variants`. It accepts a configuration object that defines the base styles, variants, and default variants for the badge. 

**Base Styles:**
The `base` property defines the common styles that apply to all badge variants. These styles include properties like `inline-flex`, `items-center`, `rounded-full`, `border`, `px-2.5`, `py-0.5`, `text-xs`, `font-semibold`, and `transition-colors`.

**Variants:**
The `variants` property defines the different styles that can be applied to the badge based on the `variant` property. The available variants are:

*   `default`: Applies the primary background and text colors.
*   `secondary`: Applies the secondary background and text colors.
*   `destructive`: Applies the destructive background and text colors.
*   `outline`: Applies the foreground text color with a border.

**Default Variants:**
The `defaultVariants` property sets the default variant for the badge to `default`. This means that if no `variant` property is specified, the badge will use the `default` variant styles.

**Usage:**

To use the `badgeVariants` function, you can call it with the desired variant property. For example:

```javascript
import { badgeVariants } from './index.js';

const defaultBadgeClasses = badgeVariants(); // Returns classes for the default variant
const secondaryBadgeClasses = badgeVariants({ variant: 'secondary' }); // Returns classes for the secondary variant
```

The `Badge` component (imported from `./badge.svelte`) is expected to use these classes to render the badge with the appropriate styles.  The Svelte component likely accepts a `variant` prop to determine which style to apply using the `badgeVariants` function.
