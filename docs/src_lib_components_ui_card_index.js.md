# index.js

## Summary
This code serves as an index file for the Card component in a Svelte application. It imports and re-exports various sub-components that make up the Card, providing a convenient way to access them.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this file is to aggregate and expose all the individual parts of the Card component (Root, Content, Header, Footer, Title, Description) for easy use in other parts of the application. It also provides aliases for these components using the `Card` prefix for better discoverability.

## Key Components
- Root: The main Card container component.
- Content: The component for the main content area of the card.
- Description: The component for adding a descriptive text within the card.
- Footer: The component for the card's footer section.
- Header: The component for the card's header section.
- Title: The component for the card's title.

## Dependencies
No external dependencies.

## Code Highlights
The code utilizes Svelte components and employs a simple re-export pattern to bundle related components under a single module. It also uses aliases to provide more descriptive names for the components, enhancing code readability and developer experience.

## Detailed Documentation
This `index.js` file acts as a central point for importing and using the Card component and its related sub-components. It imports each individual component (`Root`, `Content`, `Description`, `Footer`, `Header`, `Title`) from their respective `.svelte` files and then re-exports them. Additionally, it creates aliases for each component using the `Card` prefix (e.g., `Root as Card`, `Content as CardContent`). This allows developers to import and use the Card components in a more intuitive way. 

Example Usage:

```javascript
import { Card, CardHeader, CardContent, CardTitle, CardDescription, CardFooter } from './components/ui/card';

<Card>
  <CardHeader>
    <CardTitle>My Card</CardTitle>
    <CardDescription>A simple card component.</CardDescription>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>
    This is the main content of the card.
  </CardContent>
  <CardFooter>
    Footer content here.
  </CardFooter>
</Card>
```

This structure promotes modularity and makes it easier to maintain and update the Card component in the future.
